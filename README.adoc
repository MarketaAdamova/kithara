*kithara* is a (limited) https://www.rabbitmq.com[RabbitMQ] client for Clojure,
based on https://github.com/jhalterman/lyra[Lyra]. Its specific scope - and
thus source of its limitations - is the simple creation of RabbitMQ-based
 consumers with appropriate recovery and retry facilities.

If you're looking for a more complete RabbitMQ library you should check out

=== Quickstart

[source,clojure]

(require '[kithara.core :as rabbitmq]
         '[com.stuartsierra.component :as component])

(defonce rabbitmq-consumer
  (-> (rabbitmq/consumer
        (fn [{:keys [body]}]
          (println body))

[[building-a-consumer]]
== Building a Consumer

kithara is basically a toolbox with components handling RabbitMQ connection,
channel and queue setup. Here you'll see how to combine them.

[[building-the-handler]]
=== Handler

A handler is a function. It takes a single map (the message) and produces
another map (the confirmation) specifying how to react to the message, i.e.
whether to `ACK`, `NACK` or `REJECT` it.

==== Message Format

This is an example message:

[source,clojure]
----
{:channel      #object[com.sun.proxy.$Proxy1 0x17cd517c "net.jodah.lyra.config.Config@190abc2d"],
 :body         #object["[B" 0x13d05618 "[B@13d05618"],
 :body-raw     #object["[B" 0x13d05618 "[B@13d05618"],
 :properties   {...},
 :routing-key  "the-routing-key",
 :exchange     "the-exchange",
 :redelivered? false,
 :delivery-tag 33,
 :consumer-tag "kithara:96CDgYbID9a1IlDwDS"}
----

Most of the semantics should be clear, so just a few notes:

- `:body-raw` always contains a byte array with the raw payload.
- `:body` contains a potentially preprocessed payload (see Message Coercion),
  otherwise it's identical to `:body-raw`.
- `:properties` represents the message's https://www.rabbitmq.com/releases/rabbitmq-java-client/v3.6.1/rabbitmq-java-client-javadoc-3.6.1/com/rabbitmq/client/AMQP.BasicProperties.html[`BasicProperties`].

==== Confirmation Format

[[common-messaging-patterns]]
== Common Messaging Patterns

Kithara aims to provide easily usable implementations for common messaging
patterns and scenarios.

[[dead-letter-backoff]]
=== Backoff via Dead-Letter-Queues

The namespace http://xsc.github.io/kithara/kithara.patterns.dead-letter-backoff.html[`kithara.patterns.dead-letter-backoff`]
contains two wrappers `with-dead-letter-backoff` and
`with-durable-dead-letter-backoff` providing delayed requeuing of messages by
dispatching them to a secondary queue, the "dead letter queue", from which it'll
eventually be republished. Both wrappers have to be applied after `with-queue`.

The simplest version infers names of additional exchanges/queues using the
original consumer queue:

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[kithara.patterns.dead-letter-backoff :as dlx])

(defonce rabbitmq-consumer-with-backoff
  (-> (rabbitmq/consumer ...)
      (dlx/with-dead-letter-backoff)
      (rabbitmq/with-queue ...)
      ...))
----

Additional options can be given - see the docstring of
`with-dead-letter-backoff` for a detailed overview.

[[lower-level-api]]
== Lower-Level RabbitMQ API

Kithara wraps the official Java RabbitMQ client - but only as far as necessary
to build consumers (and patterns). You can access those functions using
the `kithara.rabbitmq.*` namespaces as outlined in the respective
http://xsc.github.io/kithara/rabbitmq/index.html[auto-generated documentation].
